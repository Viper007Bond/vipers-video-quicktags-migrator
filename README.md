# Viper's Video Quicktags Migrator

*Work in progress.*

[Viper's Video Quicktags](https://wordpress.org/plugins/vipers-video-quicktags/) hasn't been updated in years, largely because I contributed a patch to WordPress core that adds [embeds support](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) right out of the box.

Unfortunately people are still stuck using the Video Quicktags plugin to avoid their old embed shortcodes from breaking (me included). This plugin makes those old legacy shortcodes be processed by the functionality built into WordPress now, allowing you to deactivate and delete Viper's Video Quicktags.
